Ind-reflection 16/4

At the moment we are still having difficulties with user stories, as we didn't really properly estimate how heavy the user stories we came up with were. I would also like to get more familiar with android studio so working with it becomes easier.

Since we are working in pairs, I want to talk with the other group members about what I learn each week. In hat way, everyone can at least hear about what everyone else is working on.

This week my contribution didn't stand ot much compared to the others.

I've worked on trying to implement saving data to an android device, which is a basis for our program.
