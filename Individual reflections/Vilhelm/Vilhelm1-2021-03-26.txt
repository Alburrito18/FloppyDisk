First individual reflection

During the course i would like to learn how to better work in a group and actively take more responsibilities. It seems really interesting to become good at working with high "agility", right npw I don't have any specific points I've thought about that i would like to improve but I'm sure they will come in due time, at the moment I'm just exited to learn SCRUM and agility as a whole.

I am excited to help the rest of the group become comfotable with using GIT and IntelliJ, since as IT students we are more familiar with the tools compared to the I students. It will be fun to see what I can learn from them as well.

We haven't really used SCRUM yet, and I don't feel very familiar with it yet so I don't really know what to say here. I want to learn more about what it means.

So far I've been about as big a part of the team as anyone else. I'm responsible for the most likely external part, and I've done my best to help with setting up Github etc.
