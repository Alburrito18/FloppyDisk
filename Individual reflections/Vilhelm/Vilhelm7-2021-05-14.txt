Individual Reflection 7 - Vilhelm

Coming into the last week I would like to get better at view design and layouts in Android Studio, since it is a rather important part of the usability of any program or application. I will do this by trying to work on user stories that involve these things.

I want to guide people in the group who maybe have a bit less coding experience and give them some guideline on how to properly comment the code so it will be easier to understand, and also try to make the code a bit less complicated by showing more practical ways to do things if possible.

Contribution to scrum is nothing extraordinary compared to previous weeks or other team members. As from the beginning I've been the primary contact point to our PO but overall I feel our workload is pretty balanced and we have solid teamwork.

I programmed together with Jon this week and I feel like we have good teamwork and I am happy with what we got done. The code is up to standard and works well if you overlook a certain bug which we are working on (and involves other code written previously).
