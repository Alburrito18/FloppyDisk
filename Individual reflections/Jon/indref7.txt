what do I want to learn or understand better?
The coming week I feel like there is little time to really learn something completely new, and that time
is better spent improving on current functionally. Although we still have some major changes that need
to be done which might mean I have to learn a little bit about our internal functionality regarding 
certain classes.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I hope I can provide helpfullnes regarding the work I have done so far, as we are approaching
the end it would be nice to able to offer input regarding that as it's important everyone is onboard
with everything we have done and understand most of it. So when we have a summary of the work we have
done approaching the final presentation I hope I am able to explain what I have done.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I continue being a part of meetings, filling in our KPI's and being on time, I also contriubte with 
adding user stories and estimating them together with the others. I might have done more in this
regard to do more research regarding scrum, I still belive our method of working is good, although
we could maybe spend more time on the project, which is quite easy to see in hindsight, as it seems 
though to finish the project in time.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Last week I worked on a thing that would allow orders to load on starting the program. So that
the orders we have saved will appear once you start the program, then we thought we finished making it
so that we have an internal order ID tht would be automatically generated and make the orders appear in
the right order but it was bugged and will require part of next week to fix.
