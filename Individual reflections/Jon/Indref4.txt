what do I want to learn or understand better?
I still want to learn more about Android studio, so it becomes easier to implement new features, mainly the coupling between fragments and activities.


how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I hope I can learn about how our storing memory works, and how we plant to move on in the future with it.


what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Currently i have come up with some user stories together with the others, outside of that I have just generally contributed to team meetings as usual.


what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Me and some others finished a very primitive version of storing documents over time on an external storage.
