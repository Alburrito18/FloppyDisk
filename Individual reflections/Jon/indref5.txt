what do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn about how to get out our stored data, so far we have been able to store the data but not
been able to read the data. So that's something I want to learn better. Otherwise I think I just want learn new
things as they come along depending on which user story I get.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

So far I have already learnt some people how the storing part works, I hope I can learn anyone else who has
questions about, although I think most people have catched up by now. Otherwise I don't know what I can teach about,
maybe give advice in how we handle eventual stress that will come closer to the project's end.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I can continue being part of the meetings, creating user stories, estimating user stories and helping us reflect at the
end of the week so the following sprints can be improved upon. I don't believe that I currently do anything unique that
I can think of. I could maybe be more thoughful of what I do during meetings so I can remember next time.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries
I have worked on one of the more important parts of the projects regarding so I really hope that will become a part
of the team's deliveries. I also hope to continue work on that so that I gets truly functional. But this week was quite
short and stressful and there were other deadlines in other courses. So this week in particular lacked big deliveries
on my part.
