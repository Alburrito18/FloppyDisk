-what do I want to learn or understand better?
	I want to learn about storage more, this week we started working with storing data on android
	and I feel like I need to learn more about it to make it work in our project. I also want to
	learn more about the structure of how things are implemented in Android studio, specifically
	regarding fragments and activities.
-how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	I hope I will be able to learn them a bit about what I have already learned regarding storage
	I hope I can do this in the coming meeting, by just explaning what me and Vilhelm have tried
	doing.
-what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	I have hopefully made some people more understanding of what the difference between user
	stories and epics are. I think in general I have people more understanding of the terms in
	general.
-what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	Currently we are still working on what might be one of the bigger things in the program
	so that we can store things. However it's quite hard but if it's done by monday it will
	probably make future deliveries easier.
