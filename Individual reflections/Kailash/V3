Individual reflection 
__________________________________________


0. what do I want to learn or understand better?
	ANS: Still confused over the different sizes and applications of "user stories". Will check this with our handledare, aka supervisor. Moreover I want to understand how to use the different views of the Flourish tool in order to follow up on our feedback better. 


1. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	ANS: In regards to coding I have not been able to help somebody to learn something new in other ways than to explore the problem together with them and share my prior knowledge to better understand the current problem at hand. I.e. how I expect a design tool to work VS how it behaves in android studio. Basically me and my partner have spent quite some time exploring and googling for tutorials. With quite some success too. Otherwise I have used my experience from my former role as treasure of the labour market committee in order to better understand our PO and tried to help the others understand how a organisation can organize their customers in different ways. 

2. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	ANS: As of this week I am the head of KPI (yes that's a new role, created by our team). With this position I will try to handle all feedback, distribute it and also try to report back to the team. I will investigate the need for a new KPI and try to establish some sort of trend to (lagging indicator) which we can bench against. 

3. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	ANS: To notice when things are heading in the wrong direction from our KPIs. Also I like to contribute the structure of how we work. I.e. planning the user stories. Despite the confusion of the different levels I have made efforts to arrange the entire project from Epic and our PO's "why" to task on different features that we work on every sprint. 

OTHER THINGS TO MENTI@N
- Na... Nothing in particular. 

For next week: 
- Better understand flourish and use the data from the tool. 
- Make sure to understand github (by this I mean google and explore it a little more) 
	- Especially the workflow...
- Make sure that our work has more well defined user stories with better depth and clearer hierarchies.
