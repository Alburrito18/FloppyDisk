Individual reflection first week 
__________________________________________

.

0. what do I want to learn or understand better?
	ANS: how to use a VCS and the workflow for this new tool. The fundamentals of scrum and if agile working methods are the respons on inceasing VUCA in your environment how with this show in this project.   
1. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	ANS: Use the skills that are unique to me and my education to contribute with the business and overview perspective. e.g. The business model canvas is rather familiar to me. Else I can try to use the well established routines that I have learnt over the years with customer contact. Simple making sure that we are professional in our contact and the way we handle uncertainty, ambiguity and risk. e.g. keeping mutiple external partners in the loop until we've moved on for sure with one. 
2. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	ANS: I have contributed with the use of an automated chatbot (flourish) that will help us to keep track of the team and take temperature in terms of certain KPIs during the project. 
3. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	ANS: So far we've only had the social contract (which I have read and contributed to). More over this individual reflection is a form av deliverable although individual for the whole team and not directly with any deadline. I suggested that we meet up in school which has contributed, at least to my own understanding of git and VCSs, and therefore to the delivery on that.
