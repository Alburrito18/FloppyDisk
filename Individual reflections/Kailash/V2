Individual reflection first week 
__________________________________________


0. what do I want to learn or understand better?
	ANS: the projects different parts and how to tackle them. E.g. I do not know the file format perfectly, the program Fornox nor did I understand the way our PO uses these to interact with each other. Need to get a brief from those in the gang who were in the meeting with him. 

1. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	ANS: Explain my view on the business model canvas and why I think it is a bit weird to use is in a project like this. Especially with no cash flow. However it can be transfered to a more general solution and perhaps we ca speculate appropriately to that. 

2. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	ANS: I have read the feedback and planned new flourish measurements. Also I will evaluate the project so far with the rest of the team to make sure everyone is motivated to contribute. In regards to the scrum board I could have contributed more, but them again, the theory week is a bit different form a normal sprint week, so that is difficult at times.   

3. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	ANS: I missed the meeting on Thursday and by doing so I also missed the most important recap of the week, since the group decided to skip the Friday meeting. Nevertheless, I made sure to update myself on the status of our deliveries and made sure they were handed in in time. 

OTHER THINGS TO MENTI@N
- We need to get more group work done during the week. The intake of theory has been a bit weird in the sense that there was   material, but we didn't go through it properly. --> Check this with the teachers.
